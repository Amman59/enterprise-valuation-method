Valuation

In a recent trading huddle meeting Nokia's newest acquisition (Infinera) came up. Nokia was trading at €3.47 on June 26th, and €3.67 on the 1st of July, following the anouncement on the 26th of June. This represents a 576 basis point incraese in the share price.

the report is baed on the following (https://www.nokia.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/nokia-to-acquire-infinera.pdf)
I am interested in the valuation used here, as Infinera had an enterprise value of $2.3 billion. Where exactly did this number come from? And why did Nokia pay such an amount to acquire them?
Lets Look at what Infinera do. They are an Optical networking specialist who have €1.5bn Revenue, with over 60% of that in the US.
